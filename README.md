OSEPP Combination Sensor Chip Integration and LCD Integration

Requirements Name: Combination Sensor Chip Integration and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) Integration. 
Purpose: To successfully integrate an OSEPP combination temperature and humidity sensor and send the output to LCD. 
Inputs: Sensor chip data input signal to Arduino. 
Outputs: LCD output. 
Functions: To serve as a display station for these particular Air Quality attributes. 
Performance: To sense Air Quality changes rapidly for downstream sequencing purposes, polling rate desired is 5 seconds or better. 
Manufacturing Cost: Not including labor the material is going to cost approximately $80 US. 
Power: In terms of running power, 9VDC supply power to the Arduino board, and both the LCD and the combination sensor chip use board-supplied 5VDC. In terms of processing power, the Arduino Uno has an 8-Bit processor and operates at a frequency of 16 Mhz. 
Physical Size/Weight: The assembly itself occupies a small footprint, no more than that of a single circuit array board.
